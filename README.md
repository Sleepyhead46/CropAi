Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System
Description:
Developed a system to recommend suitable crops and fertilizers based on environmental and soil conditions using data collected from IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms.

Key Responsibilities:
Data is collected from various sources, including the aforementioned sensors and modules, as well as historical crop yield data from agricultural databases. The collected data is preprocessed and cleaned, ensuring its quality and reliability.
Designed and implemented sensor integration to collect soil and environmental data (e.g., pH, moisture, temperature).
The system utilizes sensors, WiFi module, GPS devices and an Arduino to extract soil properties such as pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as weather conditions including climate and rainfall.
Preprocessed and analyzed sensor data to identify patterns and correlations.
Applied machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree and Multilayer Perceptron) for crop and fertilizer prediction.
Integrated Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and other ML models for accurate recommendations.
Visualized results using Python libraries
